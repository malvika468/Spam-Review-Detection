I will never forget that day.The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.My suggestion is to wear them sparingly.",0

They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees.

The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends.

I really love this bag and will use it often for all my travels, so the potential zipper problem is the only thing I can mention.    I highly recommend the bag",5

I figured that I'd get these, and they'd be a regular dress-sock length and go to just above the curve of the calf.But, um, no.  The tops of the socks actually come right up to my knee, stopping just shy of bunching up at the joint.  On the one hand, no force on this earth could make these socks sag, which is good; on the other hand, they're a minor pain to get on.  I actually had to get hosiery advice from my wife (roll the top down, put your foot into the bottom part, and then unroll the sock up your leg), which is disturbing.More disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Ren Faire.

We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  One thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.

The skin cover is great, keeps the Zen Vision safe, no question, but everything else is low quality. The screen protector is almost impossible to apply properly, the arm band would be great if the view stand wasn't permanently attatched, and therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it.

The screen protector is a nice touch.The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty.  The belt clip is suspect- it's too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with. But the skin allows me to put the zen right in my pocket without digging out a protective bag or other cover.  The skin alone is worth the cost",7

In particular, the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most, and that's been the point of failure of two of my previous packs.  (I wish I could find one with a metal buckle.)There are two changes I would make to this design.  First, the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam.  The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3/8"" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.Besides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.  Time will tell, but I suspect this may become a failure point.  A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident.All that said, it seems like a very good pack -- the zippers and pulls are of high quality, the pockets are all lined, there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables -- and I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could -- just not 5 :-",3

These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.

"B000KWE13U:nice_tags:rex_bernard_""rex_bernard""",B000KWE13U,"I bought 10 of these tags because I travel almost every week. I got the leather tags with the cover up flap. I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.OK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.There are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK.

The sitchings were a bit more rough aound the click wheel than it is around the screen. But from other reviews i have read, there were no scratches from long term use of the case.But i have nothing to worry about because I have kept the plastic adhesive sheet that came with the iPod. So I suggest to those who want to be cautious, try buying the adhesive protective sheet if you dont have it or you could just wrap your iPod in saran wrap.After just taking my iPod out it left some sticky residue on the back, ugh, took me forever to rub it off the edges but it still left some residue.

I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.  Still - they're totally worth the investment, and I may just buy another pair, so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum",5

No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  Furthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.At first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  Another possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  What a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Kudos to the makers of Lily-Padz.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed",9

She told me that was my only option.  I asked if it were possible to send them back and forth faster than ground and she told me it would be on my dime.  Since it was their error, I expected better, but didn't get it.  I ended up getting the security tags taken care of locally, but it was a huge hassle and it sucked up a lot of precious time at an already chaotic time of year",2

The color(grey) did not fade much with all the washings, but I did find that, after a while, it lost it's shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer(dried on low), but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it. It did not wrinkle during wear(except when I slept in it) and it did not shrink at all.I liked the loose  fit, the comfy cool feeling of the fabric, and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up.

Secondly, I was attracted to the general style of these shoes, which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do. The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel. Therefore, for style and color, I would give this shoe five stars. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced. It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels. This is due to its very thin stiletto heel. Also, it is rather painful. Albeit, most five inch heels are very painful. Therefore, I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time, nor on slick surfaces. Luckily, the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg, as I expected it would. Overall, I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned. I have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them.

They were a little tight at first and took about 3 days of wearing to break them in and to not rub the back of my heel.  (I don't have a callous there so any small amount of rubbing causes great pain.)  But once they broke in they turned into fantastic shoes.
