Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving.

B0006VNOHY:poor_quality_-_worse_support:kevin_wanko,B0006VNOHY,I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this.

The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the ""Aluminum"" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money.

Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show."" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor.

I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable.

Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will ""bunch up"" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks.

They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small.

B000IGXLZW:great_shoe_with_an_updated_look:samantha,B000IGXLZW,"I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter). Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)",6,2.0

I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty ""spillover"" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.

These knicker-length pants(4 or 5 inches below your knee, depending on your height) are made of an 88% organic cotton, 12% Spandex blend. The material is just the right thickness for a sweaty practice (like Baptiste Power Yoga)-- fairly thin, but not skimpy feeling, wicks well enough, holds some moisture, but doesn't get or feel drenched during your practice.  Verve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for climbers.  That background shows in these pants -- the fit is just right, not tight (like a pair of long johns), but roomy (and stretchy) enough to allow easy movement between poses. Verve makes a longer Hanuman pant, that I have not tried.  I really like the knickers because they let you see correct positioning of your feet and don't have surplus fabric that might get in your way -- really good for Tree pose, for example",6,1.5

One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half, so it's pretty much a lost cause.That said, this is an excellent umbrella.

While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrellas shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color.The small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so.If the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars.

Being a 3-in-1 jacket has several uses. First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends.

Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands.

I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.  The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved.After a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!)

I used to have one of the new iSkins but since the ipod wouldn't fit in my car charger/FM tuner with the skin on, it took forever to peel it off everytime I wanted to use it in my car.  This works much better for me.  It's easy to quickly access and remove the ipod from the case for car use, but the rest of the time it's a great case to bring on trips.  The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly.  The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it.My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin.  If you are going to be taking the ipod out of the case on a regular basis, this is a great alternative to the iSkin",10,5.0

As a breastfeeding counselor, I always suggest to moms that they look for something without underwire (can cause plugged ducts for some moms, esp. in the beginning).  This bra gives the support without sacrificing shape or comfort.  Some comfy nursing bras (Bravado and sleep bras) give you a ""uniboob"" look-not flattering under close-fitting shirts.  This one looks awesome on.  This bra is also very forgiving of size changes, as the cups are stretchy to allow for growth (and, later, shrinking).

A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter and cooler, even though it says ""heavyweight.""  Don't let that scare you as it's not ""heavy"" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...

Don't get me wrong: I have the 6lb ball, and you use it for 90% of the workout. At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.Pros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.Cons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an ""ineffective workout"" according to the ""old"" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky.

They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footbed is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.

The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done.  I am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.

The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover and cup your balls, unlike other thongs and jocks on the market that leave some uncovered space.I love the textured look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable.  The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks.  Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.  All in all, this jockstrap by Bike offers the most when it comes to support, look and feel.",20,0.0

B000LR9ZTE:the_best_briefs_in_town_!!!:matthew_g._sherwin,B000LR9ZTE,"Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not ""bunch up"" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.The briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.If you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. My only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?Overall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs.

You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangead AND calcad, as podiatrists might say).

It makes him more comfortable when he wears them outside to get the mail, the paper, etc. because he doesn't have to worry about the side of the slipper getting wet by dew on the grass or the small puddles left by the sprinklers.They appear to be very well made and durable, he hasn't had them long enough to know if they really are but they seem to be.  We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  One thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.  According to him, because of the rubber sole wrapping up along the side prevented them from giving so they were a little tight.  We had to go a size larger than he usually wears.

The skin cover is great, keeps the Zen Vision safe, no question, but everything else is low quality. The screen protector is almost impossible to apply properly, the arm band would be great if the view stand wasn't permanently attatched, and therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it.

The screen protector is a nice touch.The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty.  The belt clip is suspect- it's too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with.

The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3/8"" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.Besides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.

Having stated that, I have been very impressed with the support of this bra.Having a larger-than-average chest size (the bra I purchased was an ""f"" cup) I have become accustomed to purchasing bras which offer support initially only to, if you'll pardon the pun, let me down within a week or so of wearing them.  ""Tisha"" has offered solid support.  This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment.As I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the ""jiggle test"".  If I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a jog ""the girls"" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bra's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.A bra is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large-busted women.

I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.OK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.There are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK.

I have been buying NB shoes for as long as I can remember, and this is the first time my toes were obviously at the very end of the toe box. They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.It's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the ""deal"". If possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) ""goofy"" looking.Overall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking/jogging/going to the gym.

I was afraid I'd be doomed to the old 1950s bulletproof, cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever...and those are anything but seductive.(I recently changed bra sizes from one that stores carried in multiple styles/selections to a 34DDD, which you have to order online or have made- at astronomical prices.) I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy.

My twins resist being swaddled (but they sleep much better swaddled) so it's important to me to have something that's fast and easy to use. I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it, and now I only used the outer wrap. I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap (designed to attach to the sack) because it seems like it could be irritating. I know that there's some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap, but I do the wrap really tight so I'm confident that there's no way it could come off and get over my babies' heads.Some tips: I tighten the velcro iteratively -- I wrap the baby snuggly once, then I open up each half and re-tighten it.

But be warned, My daughters larger text books dont fit,nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio. The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close, so she has to carry them in her hands; which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag. Spiral notebooks and mead composition books(black and white) fit perfectly. ...Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet, so the strap isn't flush to her body. Shes a tall slim 13 1/2 year old. It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better. The velcor strip is short, so there isn't much more ability to adjust to make it tighter....Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit.

But there's a very good reason.  As a sports bra, this bra is completely perfect - it has eye hooks all the way up the front, and while you may feel a bit at first like you're wearing a chest girdle, I can honestly say I've never enjoyed high-impact activities (running, aerobics) as much as I do now - precisely because it was so uncomfortable in the past.  The bra will feel tight at first, particularly around the ribs - but trust me, if you get the right size for yourself, and you follow their instructions for putting it on, you'll be amazed at what you can comfortably do",10,3.3333333333333335

A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best op002D9600,I only wish they had a 9"""" inseam.  They tend to ride up quite a bit.

The leather is smooth to the touch. I also purchased the more expensive black CLAVA ID Holder/Key chain as a gift for a man. If color isn't an issue, stick with the less expensive.  The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel. I am very pleased with the green color. It is a dark green and is very nice. (It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for, had I known what the green looked like) I love this ID/Holder Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it, I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Drivers License, credit cards, insurance cards, photos, membership cards, money, receipts, etc. One of the inside ID holders also has a zipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change. The ID holder also velcros closed, which is a nice feature. There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children. I don't think I'd use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost. Also, I like carrying my keys with the ID Holder bc I don't have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home.

B0008MF4DS:back-saving_belt!:l._rea,B0008MF4DS,"I am a physical therapist.  When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy, our joints loosen up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  This is especially notable at the sacroiliac (SI) joint of our low backs.  Instability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  At about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  As I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)I'm due in a month.  I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems",4,0.0

I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.

No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  Furthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.At first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  Another possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  What a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Kudos to the makers of Lily-Padz.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed",9,6.2

I bought this case is for storage and not hauling it around so that doesn't matter too much.  I filled it to capacity and to my surpise there is no room to add pages... Also, as with any large capacity binder, flipping pages is not a smooth action, you have to guide the page up and over, and it's hard to flip over any more than 5 pages at a time.In Summary:Pros: stylish, built well, good quality pages (the CD never has  to slide over plastic)Cons: No room for additional pages, hard to flip pages, flimsy rubber handleI did A LOT of shopping around for a CD case, I'm satisfied this case is better than all the rest I've looked at, but I just think it's possible for all these companies to build a better CD case",11,0.0

"B000BMRYTC:sunshine_shoes:ravenova_""forever_undead""",B000BMRYTC,"I was first attracted to these shoes because of their cheerful color. Secondly, I was attracted to the general style of these shoes, which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do. The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel. Therefore, for style and color, I would give this shoe five stars. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced. It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels. This is due to its very thin stiletto heel. Also, it is rather painful. Albeit, most five inch heels are very painful. Therefore, I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time, nor on slick surfaces. Luckily, the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg, as I expected it would. Overall, I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned. I have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them.

"B000FIV2GI:great_slippers,_wide_width_misleading:c._farrelly",B000FIV2GI,"The Deerking slippers are wonderful to look at, and they are very well made.  I was really impressed with that part.  Also, it was nice leather that you know will become butter-soft.  Unfortunately, I needed a wide shoe (a 9 triple E) and it wasn't even close to being wide enough, so I had to return it.  So, all-in-all it looks like a great slipper, but if you are a wide foot person, it may not work",10,3.25

B000BMAQOC:a_sure_fit:fantastic_butterfly,B000BMAQOC,I bought these shoes to wear at a friend's wedding. I danced in them all night and they didn't even hurt.
