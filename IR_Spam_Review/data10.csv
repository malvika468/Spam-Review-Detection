Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected.

Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you).

It went downhill from there.As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order.

I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat",LotteryMan43,2,"July 28, 2006"

The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).

Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory.

Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the ""Aluminum"" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money.

I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.

But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my ""Birks"". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them ""Birks"" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the ""nice ones"". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy.

As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.I love these shoes. However, they do not love me.

B0006HTWQ0:amazing:will,B0006HTWQ0,"Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials. Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this ""no-show."" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not ""cling"" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!

It is basic and simple, but seems quite durable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not ""TSA"" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.I would buy this suitcase again","Morgan Giddings ""tempest and fury""",4,"April 11, 2007"

I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit.

B000I5HPS2:comfortable:mrs._t,B000I5HPS2,"The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress.  However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable.

Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will ""bunch up"" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks.

I normally wear a size large shirt in the US, never XL.  I am 5'7"" and 185 lbs.  I bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy, and not too ""huggy"" on the fat.   I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more ""delicate"" (read: see-through).  This one is a little thicker, but still thin for a sweater.

I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.CONS:Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.  The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.The zipper is not the best quality.Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!* Or, you can always buy, try on and return.

The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in ""hand"" is worth the added function of ""wicking"" in this instance.

I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. The case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. The film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end. Fortunately, these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. And all of this for under $10??? A great deal on an excellent product.

Most of the bras are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.If this sounds familiar to you, then this is the bra for you.  It looks pretty, comes in a variety of colors, and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences.

B000145UKA:le_mystere_is_le_manifique!:c._meyer,B000145UKA,"Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits:1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning.2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed.3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating).Now there are a few things that may give you pause.1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment.2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is ""substantial"", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines.This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again",C.

They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small.

So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable.

However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual ""crowding"" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to ""improve"" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)  I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.

I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter).

B000FK1ZW2:best_nursing_bra_i've_tried:c._pettis,B000FK1ZW2,"I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty ""spillover"" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last",C. Pettis,5,"December 11, 2006"

For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).

I purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if I had the choice to do so.,anonymous reviewer,4,"September 4, 2006"

Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra. It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a ""light"" 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a ""bump"" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1"" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to ""them"" being so ""out there in front."" So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you.

Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially if your house is carpeted; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose","Amber H.

Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use.  Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles- especially through mail order- Sansha styles, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care.  The only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time.  If you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt, you may want to scuff the soles once a week.

It feels like someone is  standing in back of you suspending  the weight off your shoulders.  The pack sits high on you shoulders- stays there (no slipping or sliding) and keeps the weight off your lower back. It's compact, slim, low profile, and yet plenty roomy enough to carry a few extra books.  It's got two roomy main compartments,  and a lot bigger than it looks gadget pouch area. My main complaint is with the gadget pouch- it's not all that convenient to reach in and grab a pen or whatever, because the zipper scrunches up when you try to open the compartment.  If I had to use this as my everyday backpack, rather than my laptop backpack I think I'd get rather annoyed with this.

I do wish I had purchased the next size larger (4T) though, because I think it's just overall a little bit snug.  If he grows much he won't be able to use them.

B000FA0T7Y:lightweight_running_shoe:the_amazon_shopper,B000FA0T7Y,"Adidas has three types of shoes for their ""Ride"" shock absorption running shoes; the Gigaride, Megaride, and this - the Microride. Microride outsole consists of smaller sized absorption grooves (aka Nike Shox lookalike). Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption. Microride is more concerned with weight, it seems like.There are also two models of Microride, one with full fabric top, another with synthetic leather construction. This one is the full fabric, which is supposed to be soft, and also lighter. (The synthetic leather is supposed to be more durable.)Anyway, with the combination of Microride and full mesh top, this shoe is low and very light. I can't find a number anywhere, but once started running, the shoes feel like featherweight. The impact is a little bit harder, due to less shock absorption, so it's probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails. Overall, though, very comfortable. It's my first time with running shoes this light and I like it. With these, I achieved my fastest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected.A couple of things I did notice: the size is on the narrow/small side (compared to my Nikes), and the back heel support is a bit hard/tall for my liking. The white version gets dirty quickly. Running was good, but walking on wet road experienced slight slippage. Also, the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired",The Amazon Shopper,4,"November 11, 2006"

After they are washed and you wear them, they are pretty tight for the first 10 minutes, but after that they are just so loose on the legs. You start to loose some of the support your looking for.

(The leech DOES attach itself to your leg... but because of the sheer nylon screen between you and the leech, the parasite is simple to remove, merely by taking off the pantyhose.)  Anyway, this is NOT the jungle-warfare protective pantyhose for use in swampy terrain... but it does look good, it IS comfortable, and I was quite happy that accidentally found it.P.S. If you use nail polish to repair a run in these pantyhose, I recommend ""I'm Not Really A Waitress,"" even though it's red, and will look like a glossy little drop of blood on your leg.

At first, it was a bit strange, but I quickly came to enjoy the feel of this style of underwear. They don't bunch up or give you ""wedgies"" like boxers do because of their looseness and center-seam design. They provide support for your male stuff and stay in place throughout the day. People tend to believe that briefs are ""too tight,"" hence the term tighty whiteys. If they're too tight, you bought them too small. Simple as that. These briefs are perfect for wearing any time in any situation. I thought I might feel self conscious while wearing them, but the comfort of them overshadows any of that. If anything, I'm proud.Overall, I recommend you give these briefs a shot, no matter what underwear you tend to prefer.

They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  If I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison.  There were always wrinkles in my shirt.  Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them, but never really neat looking.My friends, my quest is over.  I have found the women's dress shirt that wears and washes like a man's.  This  Women's Wrinkle Free Dress Blouse by the Foxcroft Shirt Co. has met my high standards.  I stays neat all day (even after a brisk walk in warm, humid weather) and washes beautifully.I washed it with my husband's shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies.  It looked as good, if not better, than my husband's permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt (or wrinkles, as the case may be).The price tag is more than I usually spend, but considering the time that I will not have to spend ironing, it's worth it.

When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. They lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of durability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washings. Obviously they got kinda crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them.As for this boxer/brief/thong controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. If that means boxers, fine. If it means a thong, fine. What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns.

I have a a cheap plastic one and a weighted rope (this everlast leather weighted).  The plastic one costs only a few dollars that I use if i'm traveling for more than a couple days, and sometimes to mix it up.  The weighted rope is a good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well.This is my 4th pair because the others have eventually cracked through, which happens when it drops repeatedly against the floor at a bad angle.  One of them also just wore out in the center where there's alot of friction with the floor.  I tried another plastic handled brand, but that cracked around the same area as well, and even sooner.This is a classic, and fully recommend.  it didn't receive 5 stars only because it needs to be replaced every couple years.  but then again so do all the others.

One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half, so it's pretty much a lost cause.That said, this is an excellent umbrella. The auto-close feature is so handy if you're going to be in and out of the rain a lot, like going shopping on a rainy day. While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrellas shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color.The small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so.If the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars.

Being a 3-in-1 jacket has several uses. First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends. Only downside, it seems to be a magnet for pet hair.ALl in all, very satisfied with my jacket.

It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. bunched up) as possible generally remedies the problem.

If your wearing the wrong shoe, your feet is going to tell you because after about a week(maybe) your going to have pains in your feet, ankles, and back. I know this, through trial and error.

B000CP1MC8:great_running_shoe:daniel_j._kovac,B000CP1MC8,"Great shoe for my milage.  I recently had my ""step"" analyzed by computer to make sure I was using the correct shoe as I prepared for a half marathon. I wanted two things: Comfort and Stability (to protect my ankles).  I tried out at least 7 different shoes.  The Asics GT-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of ""give"" it had during each step.  Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands.  In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles.  Turns out it wasn't necessary.I'm running 5-11 miles per day, both on a tred mill and the road and in both conditions I'm pleased with the shoe.  I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.  The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved.After a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!) I've been using a bulky ankle brace.  Even with the brace, the shoe has been very accomodating.  I've run in wet conditions a few times and they haven't gotten too soggy, but I've yet to find a shoe that feels ""great"" in the rain.",Daniel J. Kovac,5,"October 31, 2006"

The bag is huge and it is well separated so you can divide your things exceptionally well.   It can be wheeled, carried (with top handles) or hefted on your back.   I put the bag heavily loaded on my back and carried it for about 3 blocks in Cusco.   While it wasn't the most comfortable carry - it allowed me to move faster and more easily.   The one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers.   At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined.   But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end (using small force) and the teeth seemed to be fixed.

B000GTDX2C:very_nice_gloves:beth_c._roman,B000GTDX2C,"these gloves are really nice quality, very soft both inside and out.  The suede is smooth and pliable and the shearling is not too fluffy inside but definitely enough to keep your hands warm and it feels so nice to put your hands in these.  I had a problem figuring out size so if it is any help, my husband tried them on and he is 5'9 and wears a size large in clothing.  I would say his hands are medium in size, a bit wide but average length of fingers and the medium glove fit perfectly.  I hope that helps someone who is having trouble deciding on size, for me that was the hard part. The gloves came tagged with an Amazon hang tag listing the regular price as $79.99 so I am not sure where the price they show comes from but still a great deal.

I used to have one of the new iSkins but since the ipod wouldn't fit in my car charger/FM tuner with the skin on, it took forever to peel it off everytime I wanted to use it in my car.  This works much better for me.  It's easy to quickly access and remove the ipod from the case for car use, but the rest of the time it's a great case to bring on trips.  The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly.  The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it.My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin.

As a breastfeeding counselor, I always suggest to moms that they look for something without underwire (can cause plugged ducts for some moms, esp. in the beginning).  This bra gives the support without sacrificing shape or comfort.  Some comfy nursing bras (Bravado and sleep bras) give you a ""uniboob"" look-not flattering under close-fitting shirts.  This one looks awesome on.  This bra is also very forgiving of size changes, as the cups are stretchy to allow for growth (and, later, shrinking).

The only drawback (and it can be a big drawback) is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together:  one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed.  Because of that I cannot wear the slippers.  The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it.

It's beautifully lined and the cute dome buttons are unique. The color (Java for me) was exactly as pictured. The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure. The shoulder pads (not detachable) are somewhat annoying full, but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player.For $24.99, this jacket is definitely worth it -- you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality (cashmere claim not withstanding) for this price anywhere -- at least not one that looks more expensive than $24.99! I would not pay $178 (MSRP) for it, but at the current price, I just might go back and buy another one.As for Amazon, I cannot sing enough praises about their excellent customer service!

With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...

Don't get me wrong: I have the 6lb ball, and you use it for 90% of the workout. At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.Pros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.Cons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an ""ineffective workout"" according to the ""old"" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky.

The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. Next, whil05, and it fits just nice. There is still plenty of room for my 5 subject notebook and cell and battery charger/mouse. The material is nylon and the handles are very sturdy. I also like that it zips on the top.

Make shorter, non-maternity shirts appear longer so you can wear them for longer2. Allow you to wear non-maternity pants with the button undone - even jeans!3. Hold the bands of maternity pants up so you can wear those earlier.4. Keep everything tucked in a supported so you feel more confident and less flabby.So far, I'm wearing them tucked over once, but I'm sure later in my pregnancy I will expand them to full size and they'll be an added comfort and peace of mind.

I reluctantly bought a bella band (at a salesperson's suggestion) thinking that it would be one of those products that I would come to regret spending so much money on. Surprisingly, it was the best thing I purchased when I was pregnant. I actually was able to get away with not buying any maternity clothes and just wearing my old clothing but with the pants or jeans unzipped and unbuttoned. In the last month, however, I had to wear more stretchy clothes- even my jeans would not fit with the bella band. But it is great because you can have it peek out from under the shirt you are wearing for a layered look. It is just a great product. Can't say enough good things about it.

It features a smooth, full grain, blemishless, fully lined, leather upper, and a flexible leather sole with rubberized contact patches*. There is not much more that an Allen Edmonds, costing hundreds of dollars more, will get you.I got one in size 15M, which is my normal shoe size. Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight-fitting at the arch, in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxfords (two different models). So, the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a tad smaller is correct. If I had known, I would have gotten a half-size bigger. However, that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch. I wish shoe makers had an arch fitment scale like they have with the width of the foot, i.e., medium, wide, extra wide, etc.* an earlier commenter mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come unglued after only a few months of wear; I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet, and have worn them only three or four time to date.

I have flat feet, while my friend has a really high arch, yet the Arizona Birks work wonderfully for both of us.

After my last pair fell apart I decided to spend the extra money for Birkenstocks.  I am glad I did.  You can tell how well made they are right out of the box.  They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footbed is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.  I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant.  The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support.  The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done.  I am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.

You use the click wheel and the slide on top through the silicon.It also looks pretty good.The only thing that takes some getting used to is the silicon over the click wheel.  It, like the click wheel was when I first got the iPod, takes some getting used to.  It's pretty thin and tends to buckle if you push hard.  (Don't worry, though.

The option latch that connects the shoulder straps across your chest helps, too. Also, the shape the bag allows it to be easily folded in half and stuffed in a locker when it's empty. I have only two minor complaints about this product. The main cavity of the bag isn't as roomy as I'd like, making it difficult to carry a lot of clothes, and a abdomen-level strap like the chest strap would be useful for better distribution of weight when the bag's full and heavy",Funky Dung,4,"March 23, 2007"

I felt like I had to keep tugging it up, but it just felt saggy, it didn't look saggy.  This may be because the back of the unitart is a pretty low V shape to accomadate most back styles of dresses.  I think adding velcro to the bra and the inside of my dress will solve this problem.  Also, the two pieces of boning on the sides poke my waist in rather unnaturally.

B000EYBKU6:durability_and_comfort:gabriel_r._s._bruguier,B000EYBKU6,"I purchased the Boston Clog in the summer of 2000, have worn it every year since then, and am happy to report that it is still the most comfortable shoe I possess.  Since many of the other reviews here have praised its comfort, I will briefly pass over a few of the problems that will probably occur over long-term wear.First, after about a year of wear, the outsole began to detach itself from the rest of the clog.  This was easily fixed with some shoe glue that I purchased at a shoe store.  Since applying it in 2001 or so, I have not had any further problems with the outsole coming off.Second, as mentioned in one review, the part of the outsole where your foot hits the ground most often will wear out fastest. This is to be expected.  Nevertheless, after close to seven year's worth of wear, the outsole is still holding up quite well, the heel being the only place where there is no grip pattern left.  Still, plenty of outsole remains.Finally, about a year ago the leather lining of the footbed started to detach itself from the cork underneath the heel.  Again, any good adhesive will solve the problem.  This time I used super glue--problem solved.  Overall, the leather reflects seven year's worth of use, but it is still holding up very well, both on the footbed, and on the entire upper part.  All things considered, I have worn a lot of shoes in the past seven years, many of them overpriced European brands fabled for comfort (Ecco, Camper, Clarks) but the Boston Clog has outlasted all of them in terms of durability and comfort.  I highly recommend this quality shoe",Gabriel R. S. Bruguier,5,"February 10, 2007"
"B000EYBKU6:a_lot_of_comfort_goes_a_looong_way!:sonnsett_radius_""sonn'""",B000EYBKU6,"I bought my first pair of berks from QVC and I loved them. I wore them as many places as I could because of the comfort, and  I simply refused to change shoes.  The only thing with that is the shoe ran over quicker than I anticipated so I had to buy three more pair. The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from esprit --- that is the only draw back.Since the inside of the shoe molds to your feet, it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight.  When I lost weight after having my baby, I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky soxs with my berks instead of stocking.When I first tried on my berks, they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loosen up and molded to my feet, -----  once that happened they were very comfortable from then on.Another thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right and they are uncomfortable. We wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there, but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable.

The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks.  Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.

I've put some miles in on a treadmill at the gym and outside on pavement.  Very comfortable to run in, providing stable footing and extreme cushioning.  They seem to be saving me from some of the normal knee and back pain I get running in my 4 yr old NB's.  Would be great for cross country, because the treads are somewhat knobby. Not too knobby to use on the treadmill so I'd have to say they are a great all around running shoe and are A+ for outdoors/x-country or winter running.  The goretex weather proofing didn't make my feet too hot.  Probably an overkill if you don't plan to use them for running, the knobby tread can make you trip if you're just walking, etc.  I haven't used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain/snow/ice conditions.

B000LR9ZTE:the_best_briefs_in_town_!!!:matthew_g._sherwin,B000LR9ZTE,"Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not ""bunch up"" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.The briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.If you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. My only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?Overall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs.

I won't repeat what these reviewers said except to say that I agree they are the best white socks you can get.  However, I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention.These socks are obviously well made and fairly thick.  However, they are not too thick which is a concern that I had.  They are much thicker and softer than Gold Toes Cotton Crew socks, but you must also pay for this i.e. $9.00 vs. $15.00.  On the other hand, I estimate these socks will stand up to laundering better, last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing.The exact composition of these socks is:  84% combed cotton, 15% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  The less expensive socks I reference above are 82% combed cotton, 17% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  One would think this wouldn't make much difference in terms of durability, but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks.I have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content, I don't feel they held up to repeated washing well.  I also don't think they are much better than less expensively priced socks by other manufacturers.  However, the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money","Patrick D.

(The last of these turned some heads, but they were cool enough that--in a situation where some rough characters were afoot--nobody bothered me.) They are awesomely comfortable. My tour guide in Israel was stupefied by them when I demonstrated the following: flex your knee, raising your calf until parallel with the ground, keeping your foot perpendicular to the ground, and--even without having to clench your toes--the clog WILL NOT fall off. Eytan watched spellbound as I did this over and over. The secret? You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangead AND calcad, as podiatrists might say). The Boston is so expertly crafted--and so balanced for an anatomically perfect foot--that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads, then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place.

I went searching for a new one that would replace it.  Wallets are one of those items that has to be just right.  When I read the description, I thought this one would be a pretty good replacement, and it has been, for the most part.  The zipper and zipper pull seem nice and strong.  When you open it, there is a card section with room for 9 credit cards but I doubled some up, and it does work to have 2 per slot.  There is a place under the credit card slots to put receipts or other cards.  The other half of the wallet has one zippered pocket (where I keep money) and then slots on either side for receipts, as well as a covered checkbook holder.  All-in-all this one was not as big as my old wallet, and I did have to remove some items before it would close (getting a new wallet is always a good time to clean out all the stuff you don't need anyway!).

I figured that I'd get these, and they'd be a regular dress-sock length and go to just above the curve of the calf.But, um, no.  The tops of the socks actually come right up to my knee, stopping just shy of bunching up at the joint.  On the one hand, no force on this earth could make these socks sag, which is good; on the other hand, they're a minor pain to get on.  I actually had to get hosiery advice from my wife (roll the top down, put your foot into the bottom part, and then unroll the sock up your leg), which is disturbing.More disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Ren Faire.

We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  One thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.

The skin cover is great, keeps the Zen Vision safe, no question, but everything else is low quality.

I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago, so haven't had to look for new till now. Well, almost the same sneaker... These don't seem to be made to the same last as the old models; they aren't quite as good a fit, but are still pretty comfortable, and the sole is still flexible and light weight. The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone.

In particular, the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most, and that's been the point of failure of two of my previous packs.  (I wish I could find one with a metal buckle.)There are two changes I would make to this design.  First, the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam.  The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3/8"" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.Besides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.  Time will tell, but I suspect this may become a failure point.  A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident.All that said, it seems like a very good pack -- the zippers and pulls are of high quality, the pockets are all lined, there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables -- and I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could -- just not 5 :-",SLB,4,"October 13, 2006"

I mean, with the Grail, you don't have to worry about sizing.  I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary",Hallie Engel,4,"August 19, 2005"

While much negative commentary concerning Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called ""anti-fit"" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. The 501s are pretty safe as far as sizing.",Great Faulkner's Ghost,5,"May 9, 2006"

Having stated that, I have been very impressed with the support of this bra.Having a larger-than-average chest size (the bra I purchased was an ""f"" cup) I have become accustomed to purchasing bras which offer support initially only to, if you'll pardon the pun, let me down within a week or so of wearing them.  ""Tisha"" has offered solid support.  This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment.As I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the ""jiggle test"".  If I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a jog ""the girls"" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bra's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.A bra is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large-busted women.

"B000KWE13U:nice_tags:rex_bernard_""rex_bernard""",B000KWE13U,"I bought 10 of these tags because I travel almost every week. I got the leather tags with the cover up flap. I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.OK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.There are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK. Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable. These colored tags do that","Rex Bernard ""Rex Bernard""",4,"April 1, 2007"

Ok, some stuff you need to know......this bag will charge your cellphone, ipod, pda, camera, and AA and AAA batteries (ipod and batteries require purchase of seperate adaptors.  you can find them at [...])  I think it takes about 6-8 hours to charge from nothing using the sun, but you can confirm that on the above website.  It also has an adaptor to charge the battery at home or in the car.  This backpack will NOT charge your laptop.  The space provided for the solar collection isn't big enough.  There are seperate solar arrays that you can purchase that fold up and go in a backpack (i've seen them for about $200).  The upside to the backpack is that you don't have to be stationary for it to be collecting power, unlike the folding arrays.   I wear mine while walking around chicago, or cycling to and from work and school.  The bag isn't much heavier than a ""non-solar"" bag.  Infact, once i put all my school books in it, i couldn't tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag. Even in the cold chicago winter, i can get a charge on a relatively clear day.  (i.e.  it doesn't have to be hot outside, just sunny.)  Also, be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you're ready to use it, some other manufactures have no battery, which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something.  I didn't purchase my bag through amazon, (though i must say i'm thrilled that they are carrying it now.)  I dealt directly with voltaic systems, and thx in them, so they were tight for a while and then they got loose, so either I lost weight or they got less tight.

I got out my tape measure to see if it reduced my bust measurement by the amount stated in the product information. It did! I was 1 and 1/2 inches smaller and able to wear some clothes I had always loved but that had buttons in the front causing the fabric to pull. No more.

I have been buying NB shoes for as long as I can remember, and this is the first time my toes were obviously at the very end of the toe box. They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.It's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the ""deal"". If possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) ""goofy"" looking.Overall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking/jogging/going to the gym.

B000BTPTGU:favorite_swaddler:samantha_cooper,B000BTPTGU,"I really like this swaddler. My twins resist being swaddled (but they sleep much better swaddled) so it's important to me to have something that's fast and easy to use. I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it, and now I only used the outer wrap. I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap (designed to attach to the sack) because it seems like it could be irritating. I know that there's some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap, but I do the wrap really tight so I'm confident that there's no way it could come off and get over my babies' heads.Some tips: I tighten the velcro iteratively -- I wrap the baby snuggly once, then I open up each half and re-tighten it. Also, I wrap the bottom half of my babies in a snug traditional swaddle with a blanket. They like having their legs tightly wrapped, and this system allows me to focus on their arms with the Halo wrap and on their legs with a blanket",Samantha Cooper,5,"March 13, 2007"

But be warned, My daughters larger text books dont fit,nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio. The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close, so she has to carry them in her hands; which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag. Spiral notebooks and mead composition books(black and white) fit perfectly. ...Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet, so the strap isn't flush to her body. Shes a tall slim 13 1/2 year old. It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better. The velcor strip is short, so there isn't much more ability to adjust to make it tighter....Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit.

Perfect for beach or pool or gardening or running errands, these shoes are one-piece construction with plenty of drainage for wet conditions.  They are light and pack easily, and come at a very reasonable price.Best of all, these shoes are wide.  I have wide feet, big wide ugly feet, but I rarely buy wide because the heel on such shoes is too loose for me.  The end result?  I'm limited to boxy styles from pricey european makers (ecco, dansko, etc)  that I buy in medium width -- generally about one  to one-and-a-half sizes bigger than my foot measures.  With the Kobo III, I could fit my actual size.  I haven't done that since I was a teenager.I wish I'd known about these shoes when I was pregnant and my feet got even wider!My only complaint is that they are obviously a casual sport shoe--no real way to dress them up and make them go with everything.","K in Michigan ""kinmichigan""",5,"August 14, 2006"

Bean, Fox Racing Inc., and Timberland (and Barney's New York for that matter) stock up on great, genuinely tough, useful, comfortable, and attractive clothing like these shorts--and everything else Carhartt makes.  These are clothes that make you feel and look good (""comfort clothes"" you might say) while you're rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor.I laude the previous reviewer's honesty in saying they're great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather, because they really, really are.  Jeans / denim and most cotton cloth can get hot, and that can be  real uncomfortable particularly for a man's 'bait and tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well.  They're particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower--when you're body is still all reved up--as a loose, comfortable cool-down clothing that you're fine wearing the rest of the day.The pockets and loops are also very handy, not only for working on a car, bike, or doing construction, but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone (even my Treo), keys, and wallet comfortably without being like those huge, ugly military-style thigh pockets.I expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great, functional brands that went hip-hop style or suburb/country sheik, and if they do it will be a real loss.

Alas, the ones I already had (No Boundaries, from Wal-Mart of all places) don't seem to be available anymore, so a pretty exhaustive search of online options brought me to this item.  Basically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best op002D9600,I only wish they had a 9"""" inseam.  They tend to ride up quite a bit.

The leather is smooth to the touch. I also purchased the more expensive black CLAVA ID Holder/Key chain as a gift for a man. If color isn't an issue, stick with the less expensive.  The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel. I am very pleased with the green color. It is a dark green and is very nice. (It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for, had I known what the green looked like) I love this ID/Holder Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it, I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Drivers License, credit cards, insurance cards, photos, membership cards, money, receipts, etc. One of the inside ID holders also has a zipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change. The ID holder also velcros closed, which is a nice feature. There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children. I don't think I'd use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost. Also, I like carrying my keys with the ID Holder bc I don't have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home.

I'm a male nurse, and when I wear a scrub top with the two front pockets at the base I feel like I'm wearing an apron. If I put stuff in the back pocket of scrub pants, I sit on it. Finally, I found my solution...cargo pockets! I have to deduct points because with these pants I end up wearing so many pockets that I tend to forget where I put stuff. And if I run, anything heavy in the cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me in the legs (all scrubs are loose-fitting on my chicken legs). But then I gave those points back because of the ""coolness"" factor. Let's face it, cargo pockets make you look like you are ready for anything (even if I have learned how to minimize the amount of stuff I needlessly carry around). Like most scrubs, they're very comfortable. The new sandwashed material is very durable and stain resistant. I've washed them many many times and they still look like new.

B0008MF4DS:back-saving_belt!:l._rea,B0008MF4DS,"I am a physical therapist.  When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy, our joints loosen up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  This is especially notable at the sacroiliac (SI) joint of our low backs.  Instability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  At about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  As I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)I'm due in a month.  I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems",L. Rea,5,"December 10, 2005"

I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.  Still - they're totally worth the investment, and I may just buy another pair, so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum",Gloria A. Signes,4,"April 4, 2007"

No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  Furthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.At first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  Another possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.

B0009SXC4O:choosing_a_the_right_fit_:great_faulkner's_ghost,B0009SXC4O,"If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the ""slim"" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called ""rigid denim"" looks a lot like the ""shrink to fit"" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat. Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called ""destructed"" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's. Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models.

It's extremely lightweight and it feels kind of like Tyvek. But here's the weird thing. The dang thing works.

It's the one rain jacket I took with me on my 2500 mile Canada to Mexico ride along the Great Divide. The first day it poured and this jacket did great. It's never leaked and I've used it a ton in rides around my home turf of the Pacific Northwest.After 10 months of pretty hard use the jacket did develop some little tears and if you aren't careful you can rip the material. So for a day-in, day out jacket you might want something stronger and pricier like a Burley or a Showers Pass jacket (or Rainshield's pricer nylon O2 jacket) but at $35 this jacket does better than a lot of jackets costing 4 or 5 times as much.

I explained the time issue, that I'd ordered them in plenty of time to arrive before Christmas and that they likely wouldn't make it back to me in time if they went UPS ground to Florida and back to Oregon.  She told me that was my only option.  I asked if it were possible to send them back and forth faster than ground and she told me it would be on my dime.

I bought this case is for storage and not hauling it around so that doesn't matter too much.  I filled it to capacity and to my surpise there is no room to add pages...

They  cost a little more than a year ago, but they are a very good quality and have lasted through many washings. They are very comfortable,light weight and fit loose around the ab and waist area, which I prefer to something clingy. The fit is short, but not too short, hitting just below the waist. I wear it often, and found it versatile enough to wear with low-cut jeans, for sleep, yoga and working out. The color(grey) did not fade much with all the washings, but I did find that, after a while, it lost it's shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer(dried on low), but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it. It did not wrinkle during wear(except when I slept in it) and it did not shrink at all.I liked the loose  fit, the comfy cool feeling of the fabric, and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up. I usually wear a large in most tops, but I usually go for an  X-large in short tees, so it just hits a little lower and is a little looser.And by the way..""Bare Necessities"", the store I purchased this tee through, was very good with packaging and prompt delivery.It a great buy...Happy Shopping...Lauri","L.

They fit very well, they hold the 'pod solidly  in place and they're strong. We've both used them exclusively since they arrived. There is one quirk that I'm experiencing by Hannah isn't. I may have to try one of the other colors to see if it's just the one I selected or a design issue. The ""tab"" that holds the two shell halves together protrudes slightly and when the 'pod lies flat on a surface, this tab tends to pop open. The one I've been using loses it's tension over a matter of days and the unit pops open unexpectedly. I'll try a different one to see if this is just a quirk on the one I've been using. I'd also likely file the protruding tab down by .040"" or so to help prevent the ""table contact.""

"B000BMRYTC:sunshine_shoes:ravenova_""forever_undead""",B000BMRYTC,"I was first attracted to these shoes because of their cheerful color. Secondly, I was attracted to the general style of these shoes, which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do. The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel. Therefore, for style and color, I would give this shoe five stars. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced. It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels. This is due to its very thin stiletto heel. Also, it is rather painful. Albeit, most five inch heels are very painful. Therefore, I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time, nor on slick surfaces. Luckily, the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg, as I expected it would. Overall, I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned. I have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them.

These will last for a long time!  As far as comfort, the gel soles in them work fantastic.  The leather does take a little bit of wear before it forms to your foot, meaning the top edge around the ankle (especially the heal) rubs into you for about two or three days.

First, I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included.  (I didn't pursue this.)

(I don't have a callous there so any small amount of rubbing causes great pain.)  But once they broke in they turned into fantastic shoes.

In recent years I migrated, like most people, from all-leather European-style mountain boots to lighter fabric/leather combination boots. They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes, instep and heel. I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor, if not the root of the problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional (side-to-side) rigidity.Danner's advertisement for the ""Terra Force"" boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago.The first thing I liked about the Radicals was the roomy box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots' smaller toe box. There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch. Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical's multiple widths allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters.The Terra Force torsional support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiking. Besides day hikes and 2-3 day backpacks I've used the Radicals with good results on off-trail scrambles to summits in the High Sierra and North Cascades, occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe. Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier (my size 10.5-EE's weigh 52 ounces). Best of all, after switching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately, and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially, all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Terra Force system.In my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric, but I'm not marking down my rating because that's how virtually all lightweight, relatively inexpensive boots are made these days",C.

B00080HECO:return_policy:mary_rivas,B00080HECO,"I thought I had reviewed the return policy prior to my purchase and it stated that I had 30 days to decide. When I got the suit, it states right on the receipt that there is a 25% restocking fee and that I was resposible for the shipping both ways. The suit did not fit and I didn't wear it for what I bought it for. It's now just hanging in my closet. It was a $60.00 suit. It cost $11.00 to ship it to me. If I sent it back I would have been paying over half that amount for nothing. I won't buy from another company on line that would cost so much for something that might not fit.",Mary Rivas,2,"January 10, 2007"

They look so much better than those big huge clunky sneakers. These are not cross trainers, but are similar to wrestling shoes and sneakers body builders use. I get so many compliments on them. I went to the Walking Shoe Company store in my local mall and tried them on first. These are not for people who have arch support issues. However, arch supports do fit nicely.

But this lid fit my one-year-old son's head better than it does mine.  It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke, barely covering my giant bald spot.So if you're concerned at all about it being too small, it probably is.  If you've got a smallish noggin, this would probably be a sweet beanie",Gabriel Guterres,2,"March 2, 2006"
